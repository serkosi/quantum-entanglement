# Quantum Entanglement

[NTangled Dataset](https://github.com/LSchatzki/NTangled_Datasets) is introduced to support quantum machine learning, this dataset consists of quantum states with varying degrees and types of multipartite entanglement. It serves as a benchmark for supervised learning classification tasks in quantum systems.

The repository includes trained weights for three different ansatzes:â€‹
- Hardware Efficient Ansatz
- Strongly Entangling Ansatz
- Convolutional Ansatz

These are provided across various numbers of qubits, depths, and target values of entanglement. The data is available in both Numpy (.npy) and text (.txt) formats.
